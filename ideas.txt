Compression:
Should I compress the files before I send them? I could use a basic hoffman
compression to reduce the file size without too much complexity. The new file
object would consist of [encoding table, encoded file].


Fast Update:
How should the process run in the background to not eat power / cpu
and still be able to live update files when something is added?


Support Removal:
How should the system handle file removal? Does the directory maintain
a edit date that includes when a file has been removed? If so, removal
of a file should be a supported operation.
