Goal:
Keep designated folders synced across a local network.
This should also work across platforms, not just on windows.


Subproblems:
Finding folders that should be synced

Discovering other computers running sync

Checking versions for remote vs local files

File transfer transaction has XXX phases:

1:Discovery
  ->listen to UDP broadcasts for other computers running LocalSync
  ->broadcast UDP saying that LocalSync is running, and provide a connection port.
  ->when remote is detected generate a connection response and bind to the provided port

2:Check for matched folders

3:Send / Receive file edit dates
  ->This may not be as reliable as maintaining a hashed versions history

4:Compute request for updated files
  ->Check received versions against the local versions and generate a request
    for the new files
  ->Concervitive version of this only requests new files, and never changes files
    already on disk.

5:Recive the new files and save them to the disk


"Entangled" folders are set by hidden .entangled file in fixed location, with
the following rules:
Relations are defined by line position of the sync file as follows:

/path/to/dir/one
/path/to/dir/two
/another/other/folder

will sync with the folders on the remote:

\this\is\a\windows\path
\another\win\path

With the final folder not being synced to that machine. This also allows for empty
lines to be passed over to skip earlier folders
